## Security Features

### Authentication
- All cron jobs require `CRON_SECRET` authentication
- Bearer token validation on all endpoints
- Secure environment variable management

### Error Handling
- Graceful degradation if email services fail
- Comprehensive error logging
- Non-blocking execution (cron failures don't break core functionality)

### Data Protection

- Secure link generation
- Role-based recipient filtering

## Monitoring and Logging

### Execution Tracking
- All cron jobs log execution start/end times
- Success/failure status tracking
- Email delivery confirmation
- Performance metrics collection

### Error Monitoring
- Comprehensive error logging
- Email failure tracking
- Database connection monitoring
- Performance bottleneck identification

## Deployment Configuration

### Vercel Deployment
The `vercel.json` file configures all cron jobs for Vercel deployment:

```json
{
  "crons": [
    {
      "path": "/api/cron/daily-incident-summary",
      "schedule": "0 8 * * *"
    },
    // ... other cron jobs
  ]
}
```

### Local Development
For local testing, you can trigger cron jobs manually:

```bash
# Test daily incident summary
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/cron/daily-incident-summary \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your_cron_secret"

# Test weekly compliance report
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/cron/weekly-compliance-report \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your_cron_secret"
```

## Customization Options

### Schedule Modifications
Modify the `vercel.json` file to change cron schedules:

```json
{
  "crons": [
    {
      "path": "/api/cron/daily-incident-summary",
      "schedule": "0 6 * * *"  // Changed to 6:00 AM
    }
  ]
}
```

### Email Recipients
Modify role-based recipient filtering in each cron job:

```javascript
// Example: Add supervisor role to daily reports
.in('role', ['admin', 'owner', 'manager', 'supervisor'])
```

### Report Content
Customize report content by modifying email template functions in each cron job file.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Cron Jobs Not Running**
   - Check Vercel deployment status
   - Verify `vercel.json` configuration
   - Check environment variables

2. **Email Delivery Failures**
   - Verify `RESEND_API_KEY` is correct
   - Check email recipient addresses
   - Review Resend dashboard for delivery status

3. **Database Connection Issues**
   - Verify Supabase credentials
   - Check database connection limits
   - Review Supabase dashboard

4. **Authentication Failures**
   - Verify `CRON_SECRET` matches across all jobs
   - Check authorization headers in requests
   - Review server logs for authentication errors

### Debug Mode
Enable detailed logging by setting:

```bash
NODE_ENV=development
```

### Manual Testing
Test individual cron jobs using curl commands with proper authentication headers.

## Performance Considerations

### Optimization
- Efficient database queries with proper indexing
- Minimal data processing in cron jobs
- Async email sending to prevent timeouts
- Proper error handling to prevent failures

### Monitoring
- Track execution times
- Monitor email delivery rates
- Watch database query performance
- Alert on repeated failures
